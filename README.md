# Dashboard-with-Cognos
Climate metrics visualizations using Cognos 

The measurement of soil temperature and surface pressure is a
very important procedure, it is indeed the essential data for the study
of different projects. For example: at the level of the determination of the zones
where buildings can be erected without risk of freezing, the determination
the depth of installation of the water supply pipes, as well as
the installation of heat pumps in areas where there are heat losses
heat, also it is used for the design of airport runways and roads…
The wind measurement is also very important, to understand the forecasts
meteorological and for the control of the movements of the boats as well as the
planes. These are very interesting and useful data, especially for
engineers and architects. This is why our study will concern these
factors by building a Dashboard which will be very useful in what is already
reported.

# Data extraction 
the production of this Dashboard was based on data  provided from recognized sources (which we will locate later). A work of preparation and cleaning of the data was
performed for better visibility.

we based on on NASA ACCESS VIEWER: it is a Webmapping application, "The POWER data access viewer contains meteorological and solar parameters formulated to evaluate and design systems renewable energy »

To access the coordinates of each Moroccan city, we used this site: Morocco Cities Database https://simplemaps.com/data/ma-cities

Google Colab: we relied on a python script to switch from a crosstab to a non-crosstab
